This is an Android demo app for SAPI, the Sensis Search API. See http://developers.sensis.com.au/ for more info.

This project depends on SAPI Client: https://github.com/ShardPhoenix/SapiClient

You will also need to add your API key to strings.xml as follows:

<string name="api_key">your-api-key</string>

You also need to add the following (leave them blank if you don't have or a proxy or have configured it in Android):

<string name="proxy_path">your-proxy-url</string>
<string name="proxy_port">your-proxy-port-number</string>
